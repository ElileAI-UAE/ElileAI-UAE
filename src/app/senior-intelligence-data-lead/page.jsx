                                We are seeking a senior leader to own and evolve Elile’s external intelligence and

                                platforms, dark web sources, Ad-ID, cookies and other publicly or commercially
                                available data environments.
                                <br />
                                This role sits at the intersection of intelligence collection, data structuring,
                                investigative workflows, and platform execution. It is intentionally designed for
                                candidates with either a strong engineering background, a product leadership
                                background, or a hybrid intelligence profile who have built such platforms for
                                digital intelligence in their career.
                                <br />
                                The scope includes intelligence sourced from open-source, social, dark web,
                                and externally observable platforms including advertising servers, cookies, and
                                dark web breaches, for investigative and operational decision-making.
